# FUZE Team Project (TUT5101 Group 1)

## Description:
Welcome to the FUZE Weather app! The solution to your clothing indecision! This app enables you to plan
your outfits for the week or for an upcoming trip; it will search for the weather at your
current location and make suggestions on what you should wear given the weather conditions!

The application lets you upload pictures of your entire wardrobe and will help YOU
figure out the most stylish solutions that are appropriate for your week!

## Usage:
### Uploading Clothing:
- Use your file directory to upload a .jpg image
- Note: The application will only allow images of the .jpg format
- Follow the instructions on the panel, rating your item of clothing based on how
warm the article of clothing is.
- Properly name it so that you can always refer to it later!

### Viewing Weather:
